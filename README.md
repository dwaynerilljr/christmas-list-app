# Ever wanted an easy, convenient way to make a christmas list?

The 10 year old in me couldn't wait to make my list for Christmas every year... So now I've built this web app to do the same, sans the pen and paper :)

The app is very simple an easy to use, just select Add gift and type in the name of your gift, shown below:
